# minesweeperTerminal
This is a version of the popular game Minesweeper that runs on the Terminal.
To play Minesweeper, we will create instances of MInesweeper Game
in the command line. For example:
In the command line, navigate to the lib directory
and run 'node'. Run '.load game.js' to load
the contents of this file. Then create a game instance and run the commands
like so:
let game = new Game(3, 3, 3);
game.playMove(0, 1);
game.playMove(1, 2);
When done run '.exit'
